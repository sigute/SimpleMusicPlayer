# SimpleMusicPlayer

Sample Android project. 
API used: https://hearthis.at/api-v2/

App has the following features:
- Displays the list of the most popular artists (including name, image)
- Displays the tracks when the artist is selected (including track name, album art, duration)
- Shows a basic music player and plays a song when track is selected 

Did not complete the optional features (paging, caching, rendering waveform)

Used Kotlin, MVP architecture, some common libraries such as Dagger, Retrofit and RxJava.

Reused code from previous project ( https://github.com/sigute/RepoBrowser ), modifications and new features took **~4 hours**. 

Added TODOs where things could be improved given more time, including things like loading spinners, nicer error handling, retrieving additional information, improving how media player works, etc.
